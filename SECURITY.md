## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

### How to Report

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, as this may allow noticed vulnerabilities to be exploited before we have a chance to fix them.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email to `dhrubojyoti.saha@g.bracu.ac.bd`.

Please include the following details in your report:

*   Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
*   Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
*   The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
*   Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
*   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
*   Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
*   Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

We will try to acknowledge your report within 24 hours. We will keep you updated on our progress as we investigate and fix the issue.
